The goal is to build a summary or "wrapped" concept for FPL, much like reviews such as Spotify Wrapped to evaluate a team's performance during the season. Hence, the vision is not simply to display data and stats, but to do it in a more engaging and insightful way to users.

For the first iteration, the importance of how the data and stats aren't super crucial and don't need to be super technical but should still be logical and grounded and explainable/justified. Great importance should be placed on the UI/UX for end-user, e.g. descriptive profiles of their behaviour (e.g. 16 personalities, or type of Spotify listener, type of Shopback user, etc.). Think would be nice if we sum up or describe some insight or label of the user. (Feel free to suggest!)
