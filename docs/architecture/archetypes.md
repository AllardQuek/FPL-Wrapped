Here’s a merged, FPL‑Wrapped‑friendly set of **manager archetypes**, combining your earlier categories with the 11 from the article into a tighter, data‑driven list. Each one is something you can actually detect from stats.[1][2]

## 1. The Analyst

- High use of advanced metrics: regularly owns top xG/xGI players, low number of “nostalgia” picks.[2][3]
- Few random punts; transfers align with underlying stats and good fixtures.

## 2. The Template Follower

- Very high template overlap (e.g. >80% with overall ownership most weeks).[4][1]
- Low number of differentials and hits; rank is stable, variance low.

## 3. The Copycat

- Heavy overlap with popular content‑creator teams or top‑10k template right after deadlines.[5][1]
- Brings in bandwagons **after** big hauls more often than before.

## 4. The Differential Junkie / Gambler

- Consistently owns several <10%‑owned players and captains differentials more often than average.[6][1]
- Big gameweek swings: some massive greens, some huge reds.

## 5. The Hitman / Early Transfer Addict

- High number of hits across the season; often makes multiple transfers in the same GW.[7][1]
- Transfers timestamped early in the week (right after deadline / before pressers), often chasing price changes.

## 6. The Patient Planner

- Frequently rolls a free transfer; low total hits.[8][2]
- Long average ownership spells and gradual rank movement rather than sharp swings.

## 7. The Historian

- Keeps or buys “legacy” FPL names even when their current form or minutes are poor.[1]
- Ownership skewed toward familiar stars vs up‑and‑coming options.

## 8. The Rage Quitter

- Noticeable gaps where no transfers are made and line‑ups go untouched, followed by sudden Wildcard or big overhaul.[9][1]
- Season graph shows sharp early interest, mid‑season drop, and late‑season comeback.

## 9. The Mini‑League Admin

- Joins many mini‑leagues and H2H competitions; plays almost every GW with set captain and full XI.[10][1]
- May not chase overall rank aggressively but performs strongly vs close rivals.

## 10. The God‑Tier Manager

- Consistently high overall finishes and strong mini‑league record across seasons.[11][1]
- Above‑average captaincy success rate, chip ROI, and transfer PGLT.

## 11. The Casual Enjoyer

- Missed deadlines, auto‑subs, and multiple GWs without transfers.[9][1]
- Squad contains inactive or injured players for long stretches, but still posts occasional big weeks.

***

In your UI, each manager could get **one primary archetype + 1–2 secondary traits**, e.g.  
- “You’re a **Differential Junkie** with **Early Transfer Addict** tendencies,” plus 1–2 supporting stats (hits taken, EO %, captain differentials) to keep it fun but grounded.
