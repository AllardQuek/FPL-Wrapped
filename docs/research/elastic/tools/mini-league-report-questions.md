# Mini-League Report Features

Following are features and insights managers might want from a mini-league report. Reports are designed for two scenarios: before the gameweek starts (planning) and after it ends (review).

---

## **Pre-Gameweek Report (Planning Phase)**

Reports generated before gameweek deadline to help managers understand the competitive landscape and make informed decisions.

### **Strategic Intelligence**

1. **Captaincy Spread** - Who's captaining whom? Identify consensus picks vs differentials
2. **Differential Identification** - Players owned by only 1-3 managers (potential rank swingers)
3. **Template Overlap** - % of squad overlap between managers, identify clones vs mavericks
4. **Transfer Targets** - Most transferred IN across the league this week
5. **Hit Analysis** - Who took hits (-4, -8+) and what they bought
6. **Chip Status** - Who has chips remaining? Who's wildcarding/FH/TC this week?
7. **Formation Trends** - Is everyone playing 3-4-3 or are there structural differentials?
8. **Fixture Loading** - Who doubled/tripled up on specific teams for good fixtures?
9. **Team Value Comparison** - Who has the most expensive squad? Budget remaining?
10. **Watchlist** - Players that multiple managers are watching (high transfer interest)
11. **Fixture Context** - Aggregate difficulty of all league teams' fixtures this GW

### **Competitive Context**

12. **Rank Gaps** - Current standings with points differences
13. **Catch-up Potential** - How many points needed to overtake rivals
14. **Risk Assessment** - Who's playing safe (template) vs risky (punts)?

## **Post-Gameweek Report (Review Phase)**

Reports generated after gameweek completes to analyze performance and outcomes.

### **Performance Analysis**

15. **Captaincy Winners/Losers** - Who picked the top captain? Who got punished?
16. **Bench Disasters** - Total points benched by each manager, biggest regrets
17. **Transfer Effectiveness** - Did new signings deliver? Did hits pay off (ROI)?
18. **Chip Performance** - How did bench boost/triple captain perform vs expected?
19. **Differential Success Rate** - Did unique picks haul or flop?
20. **Autosub Impact** - Who benefited most from automatic substitutions?

### **Luck vs Skill**

21. **Luck Factor** - Expected points vs actual (captains blanking, benched haulers)
22. **Clean Sheet Lottery** - Who guessed defensive returns correctly?
23. **Bonus Point Luck** - Who benefited from late BPS changes?

### **League Dynamics**

24. **Rank Changes** - Who jumped/dropped most positions?
25. **Green/Red Arrows** - Who beat/lost to league average?
26. **Biggest Movers** - Highest point scorer vs lowest in the league
27. **Head-to-Head Swings** - Key matchup outcomes affecting league positions

### **Pattern Recognition**

28. **Popular Fails** - Players owned by 5+ managers who blanked
29. **Consensus Punishments** - When the template backfires
30. **Maverick Rewards** - When going against the grain paid off

### **Highlight Moments**

33. **"If Only" Analysis** - What if you'd captained X? What if you'd benched Y?
34. **Cumulative Stats** - Season-long trends (who takes most hits, best captain success rate)

38. **Rolling Hits Strategy** - Which managers repeatedly take hits across consecutive weeks?
39. **Emergency Coverage** - How many managers are exposed with only one playing goalkeeper or no backup midfield coverage?
40. **Differential Timing Risk** - Are differentials being added early (higher conviction) or late (panic punts)?
41. **Wildcard Momentum** - Who is most likely to play a wildcard soon based on transfers and fixtures?
42. **Captaincy Safety Index** - Proportion of captains with high expected points vs volatile punts?
