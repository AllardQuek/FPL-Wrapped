## Pure FPL‑relatable season slogans

These are independent of specific managers and can be slotted under any persona based on stats:

- **Template hugger**  
  - “You started the season saying you’d be different. You ended up with the full template like everyone else.”  
  - “You whispered ‘just one more safe pick’ and finished with 10 of the same players as your rivals.”

- **Hit addict / chaos player**  
  - “Your transfer plan was simple: if in doubt, take a -4.”  
  - “You didn’t just chase points. You chased them with a -8.”

- **Bench regret merchant**  
  - “You left enough points on the bench to finish a few hundred thousand places higher.”  
  - “Your real FPL team was the bench you never trusted.”

- **Captaincy rollercoaster**  
  - “Sometimes you nailed the armband, sometimes you invented new ways to suffer.”  
  - “Your season motto: ‘Next week the captain will finally haul.’”

- **Chip drama**  
  - “You swore you’d save your chips for the doubles… then panic‑hit them in a random single gameweek.”  
  - “Your chips had two settings: absolute banger or complete disaster.”

- **Process merchant / patient planner**  
  - “You didn’t chase every bandwagon – you waited for the right ones.”  
  - “Your superpower was doing nothing while everyone else panicked.”
